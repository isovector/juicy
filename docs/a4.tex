\section{Design}

\subsection{Resolver}
\subsubsection{Building the Package Tree}
The first step of the \type{Resolver} was to iterate over each compilation unit, and build a map from fully-qualified
typenames to their corresponding definitions. Additionally, at this step we created type definitions for primitives, and
injected them into the package tree.

The package tree provides several useful functions for working with types; for example, it allows us to get any types
which might reside in a given package (\code{import pkg.*} for example):
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala]
def getPackage(pkg: QName): Map[QName, TypeDefn] = {
  val len = pkg.length
  tree
    .filter(_._1.take(len) == pkg)  // same prefix
    .filter(_._1.length == len + 1) // directly inside
    .filter(_._2.isDefined)         // not a package
    .map { case (path, classDef) =>
      path.drop(len) -> classDef.get
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\source{ast/PackageTree}{PackageTree\#getPackage}

\subsubsection{Determining Type Scopes}
For each compilation unit (internally referred to as a \type{FileNode}), we constructed a ``type scope'' -- a map from a
single identifier to any types it might resolve to -- by pulling in references from the package tree. Type scopes are
written into the AST, so later stages can take advantage of this analysis.

\subsubsection{Resolving Types}
The \type{Resolver} then performs the actual type resolution of syntactically-available types. This is implemented via a
visitor over each \type{FileNode} whose purpose is to find every \type{Typename} existing in the AST and to point it
towards its definition from the package tree. Any \type{Typename} which fails to resolve unambiguously via the type
scope results in an error.



\subsection{Knower}
\subsubsection{Inheritance Expansion}
The \type{Knower} is responsible for hierarchy checking. The most interesting part of this pass is its flattening of
class hierarchies: every class pulls all of its parent's methods into scope, respecting hiding rules. This is
implemented via a lazy recursion over a class' resolved \code{extends}.

In order to get all classes deriving from \type{java.lang.Object}, the \type{Parser} was extended with a special case to
make any class without an explicit \code{extends} clause extend from \type{java.lang.Object}.

\newpage
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala]
lazy val (inheritedMethods: Seq[MethodDefn], hidesMethods: Seq[MethodDefn]) = {
  val parentMethods =
    extnds
      .flatMap(
        _.resolved.get.inheritedMethods)
      .filter(!_.isCxr)
  val sigs =
    methods
      .map(_.signature)
  val (hides, keeps) =
    parentMethods
      .partition { parMeth =>
        sigs.contains(parMeth.signature)
      }

  (methods ++ keeps, hides)
}
\end{lstlisting}
\source{ast/AST}{TypeDefn}

\subsubsection{Interface Contract Verification}
Additionally, the \type{Knower} is responsible for determining whether classes satisfy their \code{implements}
contracts; similarly to the inheritance expansion stage, this is implemented by flattening the implementation hierarchy,
and ensuring every class has method signatures which agree with every interface in the hierarchy.

\subsection{Scoper}
\todo{JACOB}
builds a scope table for every lexical scope
errors if things are defined multiple times in the same scope
notably doesn't determine what's in scope any given statement, which lead to some issues for analysis
but this approach was taken because it will simplify codegen's variable allocation
    refer to prober for implementation of this


\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala]
node.visit { (self, context) =>
  self match {
    // ... other cases
    case Before(VarStmnt(name,_,tname,_)) =>
      if (curBlock != curClass && !curBlock.define(name, tname)) {
        // Already defined
        throw new ScopeError("Duplicate definition of variable \$name", self.from)
      }
    case Before(_: BlockStmnt) =>
      makeChildScope()
    case After(_: BlockStmnt) =>
      freeChildScope()
    case Before(_: WhileStmnt) =>
      makeChildScope()
    case After(_: WhileStmnt) =>
      freeChildScope()
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\source{scoper/Scoper}{Scoper\#apply}



\subsection{Disambiguator}
\subsubsection{Rewriter}
By the time we had the need to disambiguate names, we ran into an issue where our AST no longer provided semantic
information about what we were trying to accomplish. For example, static method calls would be represented in the AST
by:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala]
val staticCall = parse("pkg.Type.method()")
staticCall === Call(Member(Member(Id("pkg"), Id("Type")), Id("method")))
\end{lstlisting}

Notably, this doesn't reflect that \code{pkg.Type} is not a member access, but instead refers to a single ontological
entity (the type \type{pkg.Type}). Any further passes over the AST would require re-implementing parsing this chained
member access into the intended type resolution. It was decided that instead we should rewrite the AST to elide this
issue.

Unfortunately, our generalized visitor strategy (described in \textit{A1}) turned out to have insufficient power to
implement AST rewriting. A brief review of the literature suggested a technique called \textit{Scrap Your Boilerplate}
(SYB), to implement this for arbitrary trees, however, the implementation details of this strategy were deemed to be
outside the scope of our project (plus, monads are scary).

Instead, we implemented a \func{rewrite} method on every node of the AST, who was responsibile for rewriting all of its
children, constructing a new version of itself (since our AST is mostly immutable), and then rewriting this new copy of
itself. An example of this pattern is shown here:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala]
def rewrite(rule: Rewriter, context: Seq[Visitable]) = {
  val newContext = this +: context
  transfer(rule(
    IfStmnt(
      cond.rewrite(rule, newContext).asInstanceOf[Expression],
      then.rewrite(rule, newContext).asInstanceOf[BlockStmnt],
      otherwise.map(_.rewrite(rule, newContext).asInstanceOf[BlockStmnt])
    ), context))
}
\end{lstlisting}
\source{ast/AST}{IfStmnt\#rewrite}

\func{transfer} is a function which keeps metadata on the AST (for example, original source location and scope), while
\func{rule} is a partial function defined over AST nodes which returns what that node should be replaced with. To simply
visit the tree, the identity function will suffice as a \func{rule}. Unfortunately, this approach loses type-safety,
which isn't a huge issue in practice, but did make us squirm a little.


\subsubsection{Static Disambiguation}
With the \type{Rewriter} in place, it was now possible to rewrite chained member accesses representing qualified
types with static member accesses. Another pass of the AST is performed here to resolve all remaining types (those which
are not syntactically-available).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala]
node.rewrite(Rewriter { (newNode: Visitable, context: Seq[Visitable]) =>
  newNode match {
    case m: Member =>
      val folded =
        m.fold {
          case id: Id if id.status != SCOPE => Some(id)
          case _ => None
        }
      if (!folded.contains(None)) {
        val rhs = folded.flatten.last
        val path = folded.flatten.dropRight(1)
        val qname = path.map(_.name)

        if (path.last.status == TYPE) {
          val classDefn = node.resolve(qname, pkgtree, m.from).get
          StaticMember(classDefn.asInstanceOf[ClassDefn], rhs)
        } else {
          disambiguate(rhs, qname)
          m
        }
      } else m
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Analysis Probe}
The \type{AnalysisProbe} is responsible for performing static analysis over the AST; it determines whether all
statements are reachable and if all code paths necessarily return values. Additionally, since it is already walking the
control flow graph, we augment its responsibilities with checking whether or not variables are in scope (since the
\type{Scoper} only determines this on a per-block level).

An excerpt of our probing function is presented here to demonstrate the approach taken to walk the control flow graph:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala]
private def probe(reachable: Boolean, stmnt: Statement): Boolean = {
  if (!reachable)
    throw UnreachableError(stmnt)

  stmnt match {
    case BlockStmnt(stmnts) =>
      (true /: stmnts)(probe)
    case IfStmnt(_, then, otherwise) =>
      if (otherwise.isDefined)
        probe(then) || probe(otherwise.get)
      else {
        probe(then)
        true
      }
    case WhileStmnt(cond, body) =>
      cond match {
        case BoolVal(true) => false
        case BoolVal(false) => probe(false, body)
        case _ => true
      }
    // ... other cases
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Our resolving step had to be rewritten twice; the first time we realized that we had passed all of the a2
        tests, but some of them were for the wrong reasons. Instead of trying to figure out why (which we considered to
        be a dangerous undertaking), it was decided that we rewrite the logic entirely from first principles. The second
        time was when we realized that syntactically-ambiguous types needed equivalent logic for resolution, but our
        current solution was unable of handling this. As it currently stands, much of the resolving logic is not handled
        directly by the \type{Resolver} itself, but exists in the \type{FileNode} so we have access to it in later
        stages.
    \item In addition to the above issues, we found that some of our \type{Resolver} unit tests would hang indefinitely.
        Tracking down this bug led to the realization that our types were being compared by value (which was good), but
        after being resolved could contain cyclic references (which was bad). This was ``solved'' by writing a custom
        equality method for our types, but broke our unit tests which had facilities to handle the new equality logic.
        In order to fix \textit{that}, we added a means of turning off the extra equality handling for these unit tests,
        but this solution turned out to be non-reentrant, leading to non-deterministic failures in deterministic unit
        tests. In the end, we simply turned off parallel execution of unit tests.
    \item technical debt for primitives and arrays \todo{JACOB}
    \item scoper doesn't scope on a per-statement level \todo{JACOB}
    \item checker should probably have been two passes \todo{JACOB}
\end{itemize}




\section{Testing}

As in our documentation for a1, we have remained heavily dependent on a strong unit-testing infrastructure. Most
compiler passes have approximately 10 unit tests written for them, with some of the trickier ones having over 40. In
addition, we have integrated marmoset's tests into our continuous integration tests, giving us an accurate notion of how
well we are doing on the assignment. As an added bonus, we also get a huge repository of tests from previous assignments
to ensure we haven't introduced any regressions as we proceed.
